Markdown documents are suported by Yawg. The Markdown text is parsed
according to the [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) specification.





## Document title

The title of a Markdown document can be specified in the YAML front
matter at the very beginning of the document. Like this:

```
---
title: My Document Title
---
First paragraph in my document...
```
