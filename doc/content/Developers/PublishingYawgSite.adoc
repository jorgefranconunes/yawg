== Introduction

This document describes the setup and tools for publishing the
Yawg site.

The Yawg site is hosted through the https://pages.github.com/[GitHub
Pages] service provided by GitHub.

To publish new content the changes must be commited to the `gh-pages`
branch of the project. And then pushed to GitHub.

We created a tool to perform the actions for publishing the Yawg
site. This tool can be executed from the command line.

The Yawg version to be used for baking the Yawg site will be a
previously released version.
