== Downloading and installing Yawg

Tarballs of Yawg releases are hosted on
https://github.com/jorgefranconunes/yawg/releases[GitHub].

After downloading the tarball, the installation consists simply of
untaring said tarball. An example combining download and untaring
follows:

[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
----
mkdir ~/local
curl https://github.com/jorgefranconunes/yawg/releases/yawg-{latestYawgVersion}.tar.gz \
    | tar xfz -C ~/local
----

The example example above would have installed Yawg under directory
`$HOME/local/yawg-{latestYawgVersion}/`.

The only files under the installation directory you need to know about
are listed below. All other files are for internal use by Yawg. You
should not, of course, ever need to modify any of the files under the
installation directory.

* `bin/yawg` -- The command line tool for running yawg. Described in
  detail in the next section.

* `doc` -- End user documentation.
