== Requirements

For running Yawg you will need the following:

* Linux -- Any typical Linux distribution from the last five years
  should "just work" (TM).

* Java 8 -- The Oracle JVM is known to work.

* Graphviz -- But only if you want to have PlantUML diagrams in your
  content.

While Windows is not yet explicitly supported, you can still run Yawg
just fine under Cygwin.
